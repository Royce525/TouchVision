# TouchVision

In a world where technology continues to shape the way we learn and interact, ensuring inclusive education for all children, including those with visual impairments, remains an essential goal. Touch Vision represents a groundbreaking project aimed at revolutionizing the learning experience for visually impaired children through an innovative, interactive Braille learning system.

## DESCRIPTION: 
By leveraging Computer Vision, Neural Networks, and text-to-speech technology, TouchVision enables children who are blind and their parents to embark on an interactive journey of braille literacy. The objective is Empowering Visually Impaired Children with Braille Literacy. Additionally, TouchVision aims to raise awareness about braille in society to foster inclusiveness for the visually impaired population.

Visually impaired children often face challenges in accessing literacy and educational opportunities beyond the classroom's confines. By offering a user-friendly and interactive tool, TouchVision fosters independence, enhances language skills, and promotes educational opportunities beyond traditional schooling. With a Neural Network model trained on a comprehensive dataset, the application provides accurate recognition and translation of braille into English alphabets, empowering children to comprehend and interpret written language. The shared learning experience strengthens the parent-child bond and creates a supportive and nurturing environment for educational growth.

Key Features of the project:
* Audio based Interface
* Braille Writing Module
* Interactive Game Modules
* Parental Involvement
* Progress Tracking
* Accurate Recognition
* Integrates environmental awareness

## OBJECTIVES: 
To develop a CNN Based application to provide educational assistance to visually impaired learners.
* Collect a dataset of Braille characters and perform necessary pre-processing to improve image quality, addressing the lighting and orientation variations, and ensuring uniform labeling for accurate recognition.
* Develop a CNN based model to effectively recognize and interpret Braille Characters.
* Integrate the developed CNN based model into the web application, enabling real-time and accurate recognition of Braille characters to enhance the educational experience for visually impaired learners.
